# SmirnovWordsModule.hs #

A Haskell `SmirnovWordsModule.hs` module exporting four functions for calculating 
the numbers of Smirnov words over three-letter and four-letter alphabets in the 
theoretical framework of the breakthrough article 
[H. Prodinger, Ternary Smirnov words and generating functions](http://math.colgate.edu/~integers/vol18.html), Integers, 2018, 18,
Paper A69.

Based on the two Remarks made in Appendix A of the monograph
[A.O. Matveev, Symmetric Cycles: 
A 2D Perspective on Higher Dimensional Discrete Hypercubes, the Power Sets
of Finite Sets, and Set Families](https://leanpub.com/SymmetricCycles), Leanpub, 2022. See the accompanying PDF-note.
